# Background Changer

This is a Mini-Mon(mini) 💻 Project Background Changer, is made using the tech stack of HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

This uses Hex-code value to generate different colors, for every duration of one second.

Here I added more CSS to make it more fun and also look stunning where I gradually learnt more about embedding custom fonts, animation, gradient colors,

and also applying the transparent or glass effect to the buttons.
